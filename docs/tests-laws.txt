THE LAWS OF TESTING

1 - You shall NOT put expects inside conditionals blocks (if, else, catch, switch case, etc).

2 - You shall use try/catch on errors testing and success testing as well

3 - You shall NOT have lib dependencies in your tests. Use helper classes as adapters

4 - You shall make behavior tests and unit tests too
